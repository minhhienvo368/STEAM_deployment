The mission of our team is to deploy a website which collecting the data from STEAM group. The website will preview all information about a game. So our challenges could be:
+ Retrieving the data from json file and transfering it into SQL, probally, more than 3 tables in a relational data model (i.e. could present primary keys, foreign keys, their relationships)
+ Visualisation: perform some nice plots that presenting the interesting correlations between variables
+ Nice queries of SQL data.
+ Some nice web functions
